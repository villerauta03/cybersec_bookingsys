## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device (computer, tablet, or smartphone) when you visit a website or use a web application.  
They help the application remember your preferences, login session, and other information to improve your experience.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use

### ‚úÖ Essential / Strictly Necessary Cookies

These cookies are required for the operation of the application and **cannot be turned off** in our system.

We use them to:

- Maintain secure sessions during login and usage  
- Store authentication status  
- Enable core site functionality (e.g., navigating between pages, submitting forms)

**Examples:**

- `sessionid`  
- `csrftoken`

---

### üö´ No Third-Party Tracking Cookies

We do **not** use:

- Advertising cookies  
- Social media cookies  
- Analytics/tracking cookies from third parties  

Your behavior is **not tracked across other sites or platforms**.

---

## 3. Cookie Duration

- **Session cookies** are deleted automatically when you close your browser.  
- **Persistent cookies** may remain stored for a short period to remember preferences (e.g., security settings), but are kept to a minimum.

---

## 4. Your Cookie Choices

Because we only use **essential cookies**, disabling them would impact the core functionality of the application, including:

- Logging in and out  
- Submitting reservations or resource forms  
- Protecting against CSRF attacks

üîç For this reason, **cookie consent pop-ups are not required under GDPR**, as we do not use non-essential cookies.
